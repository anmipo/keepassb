KeePassB Password Manager (KeePass-compatible)
Native KeePass 1.x and 2.x support

KeePassB is a native BlackBerry 10 password manager compatible with KeePass 1.x and 2.x databases. KeePass applications are available for Windows, Mac, Linux, and all major mobile platforms. 

The original KeePass, created by Dominik Reichl, is a free multi-platform open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure cryptographic algorithms currently known (AES-256, SHA-256). 


FEATURES:
- Can create, view and edit KeePass v2 (.kdbx) databases
- Can view and edit KeePass v1 (.kdb) databases
- Supports composite master keys (password + key file)
- Supports multiple databases (work, personal, etc)
- Provides a strong password generator (customizable, too)
- Supports Quick Unlock (can provide one attempt to reopen database with an easier password)
- Can automatically backup database before saving
- Keeps previous versions of edited/deleted entries. Just in case.
- Works with BlackBerry Work Drives
- Works offline and does not have direct access to network. 
- Can synchronize via any system-integrated service (Dropbox, Box, OneDrive), if you put database file into a synchronized folder. FTP, WebDAV and other synchronization methods are possible with third-party apps (such as PlayCloud).
- Languages: English, German, Russian (for other languages check http://keepassb.com/translate)


PERMISSIONS:
- Shared Files - required to access (read and write) KeePass databases in device memory.
- That's it!


APP NAME:
KeePassB inherited its name from an Android port created in 2012. Building the native app from the scratch allowed us to engage the full power of BlackBerry 10 platform, resulting in great performance and fantastic interface. Even better, KeePassB naturally integrates into  enterprise environments. (For enterprise inquiries, please contact the developer.)
Meanwhile, the old KeePassB remains available for existing users, but further development will focus on the native app.


DISCLAIMER:
While every effort has been made to ensure reliable and error-free functionality of the application, this is a work in progress and you use it at your own risk. If you find a bug, please report it to the developer before leaving negative review.
