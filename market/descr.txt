KeePassB 2 - KeePass Built for BlackBerry
Native KeePass v1/v2 support

KeePassB 2 is a native BlackBerry 10 version of the multi-platform KeePass password manager.

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known.


FEATURES:
- View and edit KeePass v1 .kdb files
- View and edit KeePass v2 .kdbx files (beta)
- Native BlackBerry 10 interface
- Easy copying of all fields
- Instant search
- Flexible settings
- Quick unlock 
- Automatic database lock on timeout
- Automatic database backup (optional)
- Integration with Dropbox, Box and other system-wide services
- Works with BlackBerry Work Drives



CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
- Creation of new databases is not supported yet
- Changing database's password is not supported yet


VERSIONS: 
While the early KeePassB version was a modified Android port, KeePassB 2 is a native application built from the ground up.


DISCLAIMER:
While every effort has been made to ensure reliable and error-free functionality of the application, this is a work in progress and you use it at your own risk. If you find a bug, please report it to the developer before leaving negative review.

Changelog:
v2.3.0
Added v2/kdbx editing (beta). This function is experimental, so please make sure to keep the "Backup on save" option enabled.
Added multi-word search: found entries should contain each word (thanks, Milan!)
Added option to minimize app on copy (thanks, Michel!)
Minor UI improvements

v2.2.4
Fixed: lists layout on BB Passport
Fixed: pasting from clipboard did not work in some applications
Fixed: clipboard is now cleared only on timeout or when KeePassB closes; locking the database does not clear the clipboard anymore. Thus, a password from one database can now be used to unlock another database.

Fixed opening v2 databases with key file only
