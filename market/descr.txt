KeePassB 2 - KeePass Built for BlackBerry
Native KeePass v1/v2 support

KeePassB 2 is a native BlackBerry 10 version of the multi-platform KeePass password manager.

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known.


FEATURES:
- View and edit KeePass v1 .kdb files (beta)
- View (no editing yet) KeePass v2 .kdbx files (including custom string fields, file attachments and history of entry changes)
- Native BlackBerry 10 interface
- Easy copying of all fields
- Lighting-fast search
- Flexible settings
- Quick unlock 
- Automatic database lock on timeout
- Integration with Dropbox, Box and other system-wide services
- Works with BlackBerry Work Drives



CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
- Editing/saving v2 (.kdbx) databases is not supported yet.


VERSIONS: 
While the early KeePassB version was a modified Android port, KeePassB 2 is a native application built from the ground up.


DISCLAIMER:
While every effort has been made to ensure reliable and error-free functionality of the application, this is a work in progress and you use it at your own risk. If you find a bug, please report it to the developer before leaving negative review.

Changelog:
v2.2.4
Fixed: lists layout on BB Passport
