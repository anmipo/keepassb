KeePassB Password Manager (KeePass-compatible)
Cross-platform password manager


KeePassB is a native password manager app compatible with KeePass 1.x and 2.x databases. KeePass is available on all major desktop and mobile platforms.

More details at http://keepassb.com

The original KeePass, created by Dominik Reichl, is a free multi-platform open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure cryptographic algorithms currently known (AES-256, SHA-256). 


FEATURES:
- Stores your sensitive data, neatly organized in groups and encrypted with AES-256.
- Compatible with KeePass databases (client apps exist for all major desktop and mobile platforms). 
- Can view and edit both KeePass 1.x (.kdb) and 2.x (.kdbx) databases
- Supports composite master keys (password + key file)
- Supports multiple databases (work, personal, etc)
- Provides a strong password generator (customizable, too)
- Supports Quick Unlock (can provide one attempt to reopen database with an easier password)
- Can automatically backup database before saving
- Keeps previous versions of edited/deleted entries. Just in case.
- Works with BlackBerry Work Drives
- Works offline, your data stay on device
- Can synchronize via any system-integrated service (Dropbox, Box, OneDrive), if you put database file into a synchronized folder. FTP, WebDAV and other synchronization methods are possible with third-party apps (see http://keepassb.org/#qa-ftp-webdav for a walk-through).
- Available in English, German, Russian and Vietnamese


PERMISSIONS:
- Shared Files - required to access (read and write) KeePass databases in device memory.
- That's it!


APP NAME:
KeePassB inherited its name from an Android port created in 2012. Building the native app from the scratch allowed us to engage the full power of BlackBerry 10 platform, resulting in great performance and fantastic interface. Even better, KeePassB naturally integrates into  enterprise environments. (For enterprise inquiries, please contact the developer.)
Meanwhile, the old KeePassB remains available for existing users, but further development will focus on the native app.


DISCLAIMER:
While every effort has been made to ensure reliable and error-free functionality of the application, this is a work in progress and you use it at your own risk. If you find a bug, please report it to the developer before leaving negative review.
