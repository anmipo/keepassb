KeePassB 2 (native beta)
Native KeePass v2 password manager

KeePassB 2 is a native BlackBerry 10 version of the multi-platform KeePass password manager.

KeePass is a free open source password manager, which helps you to manage your passwords in a secure way. You can put all your passwords in one database, which is locked with one master key or a key file. So you only have to remember one single master password or select the key file to unlock the whole database. The databases are encrypted using the best and most secure encryption algorithms currently known.

    - Custom string fields
    - File attachments
    - History of entry changes

- Flexible settings
- Quick unlock 
- Automatic database lock on timeout
- Integration with Dropbox, Box and other system-wide services


CURRENT LIMITATIONS:
- KeePass v1 (kdb) databases are not supported.

VERSIONS: 
While the early KeePassB version was a modified Android port, KeePassB 2 is a native application built from the ground up.
