think how to handle empty login/password in smart copy
Second smart copy action clears clipboard
bug: db does not lock on app exit
make smart copy video
fix libQtSensors SIGSERGV

fix QML leak (AbstractBpsEventHandler: thread has no event dispatcher)
check if I need to create .lock file

crash on DB change is related to dropdownitem:onEnd

add import from Enpass (see ExPass and https://gist.github.com/jannikolai/a61fb8993e85479a099a)
add import from BB's Keeper

show v4 custom icons
edit v4 custom icons
when creating new entry, inherit custom icon of the group
test v4 plugin custom data
trim entry history by size
v4 entry history has a size limit (default value changed in 2.28)
check sorting of history
add keyboard shortcuts for New/Delete/Edit
restore/delete history entry

=== smart copy ===
copy next field when user taps the KPB's active frame (open - copy - minimize)
also, check screen-top instant preview notifications
run_when_backgrounded is required for QSensor::alwaysOn, but is not prompted from the user
on smart copy show a toast with hint and a help button
smart copy settings (use proximity sensor, use left-right tilt, none); also show short help about current setting
warn smart copy won't work with "lock on minimize"
activate sensor on app minimized
clear smart copy on full DB lock


Later:

Show quick lock status in active frame, too
support v4 entry tags
Search: show group names in headers
subtype QByteArray and introduce safeClear into destructor; use that in critical places
move keyfile/database to/from private application-specific data folder instead of shared files
Add 10.3 SDK support (design units + main action)
BB Password Keeper import
add password quality meter
change from PwStreamUtilsV4 to specialised child of XmlStreamReader/Writer (which keeps Salsa20 state, too) 
add context menu to remove historical entries
check V4 timestamps across different timezones
addon browser app: installed separately, can get invocation from KPB and fill forms
 

Won't fix:

unicode passwords do not work with V3 (also in KeePassDroid)
make blue background for search? - nope, simply cover the titlebar
Bug: can open About and Settings many times 
OTP support
(somewhat there) add an option to disable keeping file history - needs reliable clearing of the loaded options
copy to clipboard and settings as in-app purchase? - nope, they won't buy
Once saving is stable, update lastAccessTime on view - nope, saving would be unexpected and might take long time 
"Read-only" option once editing is implemented - autobackup option instead
